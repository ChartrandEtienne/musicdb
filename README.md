This is a simple piece of code I wrote to explore the basics of the programming language Go.

It simply walks a directory to find mp3 files, reads their id3 tags and builds up a database of tracks per albums per bands. 

Simple and rather useless, but it served its purpose of letting me get familiar with Go. 

Program main function is in musicdb.go

Thanks!
